### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About me

An independent thinker who approaches problems with a rigorous, rational and systematic mind. And with my curiosity, persistence, irreverence and logic, I tend to find innovative solutions to complex problems.

I tend to be bold, assertive and hard working. I'm good with details, particularly technical details, and I enjoy talking about my work with others.

I am highly loyal to friends and family. And I like to share the status and other perquisites my excellent work has bestowed on me with those who are close to me.

Although I'm good with people and enjoy being part of a stable and secure social network, I easily spend time alone, pursuing my own projects and goals.

I tend to be protective and pragmatic. And my friends and family find me innovative and interesting to be with.

I work best in any environment that gives Equal Opportunity, Diversity and Non-Discriminatory.

I can also learn really fast if I wanted to or if given the chance.
